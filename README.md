MySQL Configuration:
Database Connection URL: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/project_db
Username: your_username
Password: your_password

2.Log into the Website:
The server port is 8080. After successful startup, visit http://localhost:8080/. Usernames and passwords are stored in the user information table of the database.

3.Backend Framework:
The backend framework used is the Spring Boot framework.

4.Import SQL File:
The project's database file is self-created and does not require importing a file.

5.Start the Project:
The project can be started by directly running the Application.java file. Ensure your development environment is configured correctly, and the project dependencies are installed.
